    "content": "This question is within my defined knowledge scope. Let's address it step-by-step.\n\nLoops in Python are constructs that allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code. They are essential for automating repetitive tasks. Python supports two main types of loops:\n\n---\n\n 1. for Loop\nIterates over a sequence (e.g., list, string, range) a defined number of times.\n\nSyntax:  \npython\nfor variable in iterable:\n     Code to execute\n\nExample:  \npython\n Loop through numbers 0 to 4\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(i)   Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:  \nrange(5) generates numbers 0 to 4.  \nOn each iteration, i takes the next value.  \nprint(i) executes for every value of i.\n\n---\n\n 2. while Loop\nExecutes as long as a specified condition is True.\n\nSyntax:  \npython\nwhile condition:\n     Code to execute\n\nExample:  \npython\ncount = 0\nwhile count < 5:\n    print(count)\n    count += 1   Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:  \nThe loop checks count < 5 before each iteration.  \nIf true, it prints count and increments it by 1.  \nStops when count equals 5 (condition becomes false).\n\n---\n\nKey Rules:  \nAlways ensure loops have exit conditions to avoid infinite loops.  \nUse indentation (4 spaces) consistently in Python to define code blocks.\n\nLet me know if you need further clarification!"
