    "content": "To solve the problem of finding the expressions involving implicit differentiation, we start with the given equation:\n\n\\[ x^2 + \\frac{1}{2y^2} + \\frac{1}{3z^2} - 1 = 0 \\]\n\nThis equation relates the variables \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\). The task is to find the expressions \\( -z y^{-x} \\) and \\( -z y^{-y} \\).\n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Understanding the Equation**: The given equation is a constraint involving \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\). Implicit differentiation is used to find relationships between the partial derivatives of these variables.\n2. **Partial Derivatives of \\( z \\)**:\n   - Differentiating with respect to \\( x \\):\n     \\[ 2x - \\frac{2}{3z^3} \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x} = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x} = 3x z^3 \\]\n   - Differentiating with respect to \\( y \\):\n     \\[ -\\frac{1}{y^3} - \\frac{2}{3z^3} \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y} = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{3z^3}{2y^3} \\]\n3. **Differentiating the Expressions**:\n   - For \\( -z y^{-x} \\):\n     - Using the product rule and chain rule, we find the partial derivatives with respect to \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n   - For \\( -z y^{-y} \\):\n     - Similarly, applying the product rule and chain rule, we derive the partial derivatives with respect to \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the ambiguity in the problem statement regarding the specific differentiation variable ( \\( x \\) or \\( y \\)), the expressions \\( -z y^{-x} \\) and \\( -z y^{-y} \\) are derived based on the implicit differentiation of the given equation. The final expressions are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-z y^{-x}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\boxed{-z y^{-y}}\n\\]\n"
