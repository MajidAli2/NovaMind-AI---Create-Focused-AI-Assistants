    "content": "Java is a **high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language** designed for flexibility, portability, and scalability. Here's a breakdown of its key aspects:\n\n---\n\n### **Core Features & Purpose**\n1. **Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)**  \n   Java programs are compiled into **bytecode**, which runs on any device with a **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**. This makes Java platform-independent.\n\n2. **Object-Oriented Design**  \n   Emphasizes concepts like **classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism**, and encapsulation for modular, reusable code.\n\n3. **Automatic Memory Management**  \n   Uses **garbage collection** to handle memory allocation and deallocation, reducing manual errors.\n\n4. **Strong Typing & Security**  \n   Variables must be declared with specific types (e.g., `int`, `String`), and includes built-in security for bytecode verification.\n\n5. **Multithreading**  \n   Built-in support for concurrent programming, enabling efficient handling of multiple tasks simultaneously.\n\n---\n\n### **History**\n- Created by **James Gosling, Patrick Naughton, and a team at Sun Microsystems** (mid-1990s).\n- Acquired by **Oracle Corporation** in 2010 after Sun was purchased.\n- Java 17 (LTS: Long-Term Support) is the current stable version (as of 2023).\n\n---\n\n### **Key Components**\n1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**  \n   Tools for development (javac compiler, JavaDoc, etc.).\n2. **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**  \n   Includes the JVM and core libraries to run Java apps.\n3. **Java SE (Standard Edition)**  \n   Core language features.\n4. **Java EE (Enterprise Edition)**  \n   Tools for building large-scale enterprise applications.\n5. **Java ME (Micro Edition)**  \n   For mobile applications (less common today).\n\n---\n\n### **Ecosystem & Use Cases**\n- **Libraries & Frameworks**:  \n  - **Spring Framework**: For enterprise apps and APIs.  \n  - **Hibernate**: ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for databases.  \n  - **Apache Kafka**: Messaging systems.  \n  - **GraalVM**: For high-performance applications.  \n- **Android Development**: Historically used for Android apps (Kotlin is now preferred, but Java remains relevant).  \n- **Big Data Tools**: Hadoop, Apache Spark.  \n- **Enterprise Systems**: Banking, healthcare, and large-scale applications.  \n- **Scientific & Financial Applications**: Reliability and security make it ideal for critical systems.\n\n---\n\n### **Challenges**\n- **Memory Usage**: Higher than some modern languages.  \n- **Verbosity**: Syntax can be more wordy compared to languages like Python.  \n- **Declining Applets**: Java applets for web browsers are obsolete.  \n- **Competition**: Languages like Kotlin (for Android) and Python (for scripting/AI) have gained traction.\n\n---\n\n### **Why Java Remains Relevant**\n- **Mature Ecosystem**: Massive community support and documentation.  \n- **Cross-Platform Reliability**: Proven performance in enterprise environments.  \n- **Android Legacy**: Millions of existing apps use Java.  \n- **Concurrency Tools**: Ideal for scalable server-side applications.\n\n---\n\nIn short, Java empowers developers to build robust, secure, and scalable applications across platforms, which is why it remains a cornerstone of modern software development.\n"

    "content": "Java is a **versatile, high-level programming language** known for its **platform independence** (via the **Java Virtual Machine**), and its **object-oriented design**. It\u2019s widely used for building robust, scalable applications across industries. Here\u2019s a concise breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Characteristics**\n- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**: Uses concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism for modular, reusable code.\n- **Platform Independence**: Java code is compiled into **bytecode**, which runs anywhere with a **JVM** (Java Virtual Machine), enabling the \"Write Once, Run Anywhere\" (WORA) principle.\n- **Automatic Memory Management**: Uses **garbage collection** to handle memory allocation/deallocation, reducing manual errors.\n- **Multithreading**: Built-in support for concurrent programming (running multiple tasks at once).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Key Use Cases**\n- **Android Apps**: Historically the primary language for Android (though Kotlin is now preferred).\n- **Enterprise Software**: Large-scale systems like banking, healthcare, and ERP (e.g., Oracle\u2019s middleware, Apache Kafka).\n- **Back-End Development**: Frameworks like **Spring** and **Hibernate** power scalable web services.\n- **Big Data & Cloud Tools**: Hadoop, Apache Spark, and cloud platforms (AWS, Azure) use Java for distributed systems.\n- **Scientific Applications**: High-performance computation (e.g., simulations, finance).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Ecosystem & Tools**\n- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Tools for building Java apps (compiler, debugger, libraries).\n- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**: Required to run Java apps (includes JVM and core libraries).\n- **Frameworks**: Spring Boot (microservices), Hibernate (ORM), Play Framework (web apps).\n- **Libraries**: Apache Commons, Guava, and JDK\u2019s own collections framework.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Pros & Cons**\n- **Pros**:\n  - Mature ecosystem with vast community support.\n  - Strong type safety (reduces runtime errors).\n  - Security features (e.g., bytecode verification).\n  - Long-term support (LTS) versions (e.g., Java 17, 21).\n- **Cons**:\n  - Verbose syntax compared to modern languages (e.g., Kotlin, Python).\n  - Higher memory usage than some alternatives.\n  - Declining relevance in mobile development (replaced by Kotlin).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Why Java Still Matters**\n- **Industry Adoption**: Powers 90%+ of enterprise apps (e.g., Google, Amazon).\n- **Job Market**: Java developers remain highly sought after.\n- **Academic Standard**: A foundational language in computer science curricula.\n- **Modern Enhancements**: Features like `Pattern Matching`, modules, and records in recent versions.\n\n---\n\n### **Java vs. JavaScript**\n- **Java**: A full-fledged OOP language for standalone/multi-platform apps (desktop, web, mobile via Android).\n- **JavaScript**: A scripting language for web browsers, now used in back-end (Node.js) and mobile (React Native).\n\n---\n\nJava\u2019s blend of portability, performance, and flexibility keeps it central to modern tech, despite newer rivals. It\u2019s a go-to choice for building mission-critical systems where reliability matters most. 🚀\n"

    "content": "The first Prime Minister of Pakistan was **Liaquat Ali Khan**. He held office from **August 11, 1947** (the date Pakistan became independent) until his assassination on **October 7, 1951**. Here's a concise overview:\n\n- **Role**: As Prime Minister, he served as the head of government and played a key role in shaping Pakistan's early policies. He was also the country's **first Defense Minister**.\n- **Background**: A close political colleague of Muhammad Ali Jinnah (Pakistan's founder and first Governor-General), Liaquat was a central figure in the Pakistan Movement.\n- **Legacy**: His assassination marked the end of Pakistan's inaugural democratic government, leading to a period of political instability before Ayub Khan's martial law in the 1950s.\n\n**Note**: Before Liaquat Ali Khan, **Muhammad Ali Jinnah** was the **Governor-General of Pakistan** (head of state) from 1947 to 1948. Jinnah died shortly after independence, leaving Liaquat Ali Khan to lead the nation as Prime Minister.\n"

This is an optimization problem that can be solved using Lagrange multipliers. <b>📝 Solution Steps:<\/b><br> <b>Step 1:<\/b> Define the Lagrangian: \\mathcal{L}(x, y, \\lambda) = xy - \\lambda(x^2 + y^2 - 25). Step 2: Compute partial derivatives and set them to zero: \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x} = y - 2\\lambda x = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y = 2\\lambda x \\quad \\text{(1)}, \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y} = x - 2\\lambda y = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 2\\lambda y \\quad \\text{(2)}, \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\lambda} = -(x^2 + y^2 - 25) = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x^2 + y^2 = 25 \\quad \\text{(3)}. Step 3: Substitute (1) into (2): From (1): \\lambda = \\frac{y}{2x} . Plug into (2): x = 2 \\cdot \\frac{y}{2x} \\cdot y \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = \\frac{y^2}{x} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x^2 = y^2. Step 4: From x^2 = y^2 and (3): x^2 + x^2 = 25 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2x^2 = 25 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = \\pm \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\quad y = \\pm \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{2}}. Step 5: Evaluate f(x, y) at critical points: Maximum occurs at \\left( \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) : f\\left( \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) = \\frac{25}{2} = 12.5. <\/div>"
