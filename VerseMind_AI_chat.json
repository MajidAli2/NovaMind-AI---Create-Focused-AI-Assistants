Her fingers brushed a tarnished silver locket, its hinge creaking with the weight of memories. Inside lay a faded photograph of a woman smiling\u2014*her grandmother, alive before the illness that took her*.  \n\nBut when Elara closed the locket, its surface shimmered, and a cold wind swept through the room. The photograph blushed gold, revealing a hidden message scrawled in her grandmother\u2019s handwriting: *\u201cWhen you\u2019re ready, find the storm.\u201d*  \n\nCuriosity burned, Elara ventured outside, the locket warm against her skin. She sought a storm\u2014any storm. Instead, she found a field of wildflowers, their petals trembling as if caught in a breeze that wasn\u2019t there. In the center stood a figure wrapped in gray, awaiting her.  \n\n\u201cI kept this to remind myself of the storms we\u2019d mend,\u201d the stranger whispered, their voice echoing with Elara\u2019s own grief. \u201cWe all carry them. Let me teach you to hold them without breaking.\u201d  \n\nTogether, they pressed the locket to their chests. Elara\u2019s tears fell, not of sorrow, but of release. The figure\u2019s form dissolved into light, leaving only the locket\u2014now emptied of its magic, yet heavy with a new truth.  \n\nElara returned home, the locket clutched like a secret. That night, she placed it on her grandmother\u2019s grave. The storm that followed kept its distance, but the wind carried a single, tender sigh.  \n\n*Some emotions are meant to be shared, not locked away.*  \n\nThe locket sat there, forever quiet, as if it knew exactly what to do with the tears it had once held.\n"
